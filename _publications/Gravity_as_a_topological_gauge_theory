excerpt: 'We describe a topological theory of gravity with action consisting of a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers of the Manifold. Two examples are studied, the first being a Lorentzian Cartan geometry (dS and AdS spacetimes for example).
The other example being conformal Cartan geometry.'
