# a topological theory of gravity with action consisting of a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers of the Manifold. Two examples are studied, the first being a Lorentzian Cartan geometry (dS and AdS spacetimes are particular cases).

<!-- We describe a topological theory of gravity by building an action from the Characteristic numbers of a manifold with Cartan geometry. 

Two geometries are studied : Lorentzian (includes dS and AdS) and Conformal.

For a Lorentzian geometry if one one only considers the Euler number we retrieve Mac-Dowell Mansouri gravity. Considering a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers as an action allows to retrieve the Holst term as well as a cosmological constant and Nieh-Yan, Pontrjagin, and Euler terms relative to spacetime curvature R and torsion T with only 4 free parameters corresponding to Newton's constant, the cosmological constant and the Barbero-Immirzi parameter as well as the coupling constant of the Nieh-Yan term.

The case of a Conformal geometry encapsulates the Lorentzian one since by specifying conditions on the Cartan connection we can retrieve the action obtained from Lorentzian geometry. -->

We describe gauge theories which allow to retrieve a large class of gravitational theories, including, MacDowell-Mansouri gravity and its topological extension to Loop Quantum Gravity via the Pontrjagin characteristic class involving the Nieh-Yan term. Considering symmetric spaces parametrized by mutations allows to naturally obtain a bare cosmological constant which in particular cases gives rise to a positive effective cosmological constant while having an AdS spacetime.
Two examples are studied, Lorentzian geometry (including dS and AdS spacetimes) and Lorentz×Weyl geometry. In the latter case we prove the equations of motion exhibit a secondary source for curvature in addition to the usual energy-momentum tensor. This additional source is expressed in terms of the spin density of matter, torsion and their variations.
Finally, we show that the gauge + matter actions constructed from invariant polynomials are asymptotically topological if one assumes a vanishing bare cosmological constant together with gauge and matter fields having compact support.
