excerpt: 'We describe a topological theory of gravity with action consisting of a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers of the Manifold. Two examples are studied, the first being a Lorentzian Cartan geometry (dS and AdS spacetimes for example).
The other example being conformal Cartan geometry.'

We describe a topological theory of gravity by building an action from the Characteristic numbers of a manifold with Cartan geometry. In case one only considers the Euler number we retrieve Mac-Dowell Mansouri gravity. Considering a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers as an action allows to retrieve the Holst term as well as a cosmological constant and Nieh-Yan, Pontrjagin, and Euler terms relative to spacetime curvature R and torsion T with only 3 free parameters corresponding to Newton's constant, the cosmological constant and the Barbero-Immirzi parameter.
