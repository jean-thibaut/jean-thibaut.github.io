excerpt: 'The first part of the thesis studies the formulation of gravitational gauge theories with local geometry described by Lie algebras with structure fields instead of structure constants and highlights applications to alleviate some of the tensions in cosmology and curvature singularity problems in gravitational theories. The second part of the thesis develops a unified framework based on broken splittings of Atiyah short exact sequences of Lie algebroids to describe both ordinary gauge theories with a Higgs sector and the BRST formalism.

# a topological theory of gravity with action consisting of a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers of the Manifold. Two examples are studied, the first being a Lorentzian Cartan geometry (dS and AdS spacetimes are particular cases).
# The other example being conformal Cartan geometry.

<!-- We describe a topological theory of gravity by building an action from the Characteristic numbers of a manifold with Cartan geometry. 

Two geometries are studied : Lorentzian (includes dS and AdS) and Conformal.

For a Lorentzian geometry if one one only considers the Euler number we retrieve Mac-Dowell Mansouri gravity. Considering a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers as an action allows to retrieve the Holst term as well as a cosmological constant and Nieh-Yan, Pontrjagin, and Euler terms relative to spacetime curvature R and torsion T with only 4 free parameters corresponding to Newton's constant, the cosmological constant and the Barbero-Immirzi parameter as well as the coupling constant of the Nieh-Yan term.

The case of a Conformal geometry encapsulates the Lorentzian one since by specifying conditions on the Cartan connection we can retrieve the action obtained from Lorentzian geometry. -->

The first part of the thesis studies the formulation of gravitational gauge theories with local geometry described by Lie algebras with structure fields instead of structure constants and highlights applications to alleviate some of the tensions in cosmology and curvature singularity problems in gravitational theories. The second part of the thesis develops a unified framework based on broken splittings of Atiyah short exact sequences of Lie algebroids to describe both ordinary gauge theories with a Higgs sector and the BRST formalism. We finally adapt the results of the first part of the thesis to generalized gauge theories on Lie algebroids, thus providing a unified structure to describe these different applica- tions.

<!-- We describe gauge theories which allow to retrieve a large class of gravitational
theories, including, MacDowell-Mansouri gravity and its topological extension to
Loop Quantum Gravity via the Pontrjagin characteristic class involving the Nieh-
Yan term. Considering symmetric spaces parametrized by mutations allows to nat-
urally obtain a bare cosmological constant which in particular cases gives rise to a
positive effective cosmological constant while having an AdS spacetime.
Two examples are studied, Lorentzian geometry (including dS and AdS space-
times) and Lorentz×Weyl geometry. In the latter case we prove the equations of
motion exhibit a secondary source for curvature in addition to the usual energy-
momentum tensor. This additional source is expressed in terms of the spin density
of matter, torsion and their variations.
Finally, we show that the gauge + matter actions constructed from invariant
polynomials are asymptotically topological if one assumes a vanishing bare cosmo-
logical constant together with gauge and matter fields having compact support. -->
